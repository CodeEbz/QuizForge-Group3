## ✨ Key Features

* **AI-Generated Quizzes**: Uses Groq's Llama 3.1 models to generate unique, topic-specific questions on demand.
* **Smart Question Pooling**: For each subject and difficulty, the system generates a pool of questions (30 for Easy, 40 for Medium, 60 for Hard) and randomly selects the exact number needed (20/30/50). This ensures fast loading, uniqueness, and efficient caching.
* **15+ Subjects**: JavaScript, React, Python, Algorithms, Data Structures, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, Node.js, Express, Java, C++, C#, SQL, and more.
* **3 Difficulty Levels**: Easy (20 Qs), Medium (30 Qs), Hard (50 Qs) with built-in timers.
* **Instant Scoring & Explanations**: Automatic grading with detailed answer reviews and AI-generated explanations.
* **Guest Mode**: Instantly explore the platform without registration – choose from a curated set of predefined quizzes.
* **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with password hashing (bcrypt) and input validation.
* **Interactive Dashboards**: Dynamic landing hub displaying summary statistics, recent attempt history, and global leaderboard.
* **Performance Analytics**: Visual breakdown of performance by subject and difficulty.
* **Flag for Review**: Mark questions you're unsure about and revisit them during review.
* **Responsive UI**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices.
* **User Profile**: Displays user name and email – editing has been removed for simplicity and security.

## 👥 Team Roles & Task Division

### 👑 Project Management & Coordination
* **Eno** (*Project Coordinator*):
  - Directed team communications, scheduled project checkpoints, aligned frontend/backend milestones, and supervised end-to-end integration and delivery.

### 💻 Frontend Development Team
* **Ali & Queen** (*Auth Page*):
  - Implemented the registration and login interface (`Auth.jsx`), integrated with backend `/api/auth` endpoints, form validation, and password reset mock-up.
* **Isaac** (*Dashboard Page*):
  - Built the main landing hub (`Dashboard.jsx`), integrating dynamic statistics, recent activity feeds, and mini-leaderboard.
* **Esther & Fola** (*Quiz Page*):
  - Developed the core test-taking view (`QuizPage.jsx`), managing local state for answers, timer, navigation, and flagging questions.
* **Maxwell** (*Score Page*):
  - Created the results scorecard (`ScorePage.jsx`) with correct/wrong breakdowns, percentage display, and detailed answer review.
* **Onovo** (*Statistics Page*):
  - Authored the metrics panel (`Statistics.jsx`) with subject-based performance bars and difficulty breakdown.
* **Ayo & Nath** (*Profile Page*):
  - Programmed the account details settings page (`Profile.jsx`) – now a read‑only view showing user name and email with no edit functionality for simplicity.
* **Oluwafaloba** (*UI/UX Design & Styling*):

* **Collins** (*Database Manager*):
  - Designed and maintained MongoDB schemas (User, Quiz, Attempt) with optimized indexes and seeding scripts.
* **Neeza** (*AI Integration & Full-Stack Engineer*):
  - Integrated Groq AI SDK (`groqService.js`) for dynamic question generation with Llama models, implementing **question pooling**, **exact‑match deduplication**, and **strict validation** to ensure high‑quality question banks.
  - Built the dynamic quiz generation endpoint (`/quizzes/generate`) with fallback to Open Trivia DB for the "Other" category.
  - Developed guest mode support with predefined static quizzes and API mocking.
  - Optimised generation by using parallel chunking and rate‑limit handling.

## 🚀 Local Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local instance or MongoDB Atlas)

### Step 1: Set up the Server
1. Navigate to the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials:
   - `MONGODB_URI` – your MongoDB connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET` – a strong random secret
   - `GROQ_API_KEY` – your API key from Groq Console
4. Seed the database with initial quiz data (optional):
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```
5. Start the backend development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Step 2: Set up the Client
1. Navigate to the client folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the Vite React development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The client runs on `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🌐 Production Deployment Guide

### Server Deployment (e.g., Render)
1. Create a Web Service pointing to your backend repository.
2. Set environment variables:
   - `PORT`: 10000 (Render handles this)
   - `NODE_ENV`: production
   - `MONGODB_URI`: your MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - `JWT_SECRET`: a long, randomly generated secret
   - `GROQ_API_KEY`: your Groq API key
   - `CLIENT_ORIGINS`: your frontend URL (e.g., `https://quizforge.vercel.app`)

### Client Deployment (e.g., Vercel)
1. Import the `client/` folder to Vercel.
2. Update the `API_BASE` in `client/src/services/api.js` to point to your live backend:
   ```javascript
   const API_BASE = "https://your-backend-service.onrender.com/api";
   ```
3. Deploy – Vercel will build the React app and serve it via CDN.
